1.what is computer?

ans:-	A computer is an electronic device that can perform a variety of tasks by executing pre-programmed instructions or programs. At its core, a computer is made up of hardware components such as a processor (CPU), memory (RAM), storage devices (hard drive or solid-state drive), input devices (keyboard and mouse), output devices (monitor or printer), and various other peripherals.

		Computers can be used for a wide range of purposes, such as browsing the internet, sending and receiving email, creating and editing documents, 			playing video games, running software applications, and many others.

		The instructions that a computer executes are typically written in programming languages, which are sets of instructions that can be translated 			into machine language (binary code) that the computer can understand and execute.

		Over time, computers have become smaller, faster, and more powerful, and they have revolutionized the way we live and work. Today, computers a
			are used in virtually every industry, from healthcare and finance to entertainment and education

2.what is RAM?
ans:- 	RAM stands for Random Access Memory. It is a type of computer memory that is used to temporarily store data and instructions that the computer's 		CPU (central processing unit) needs to access quickly. RAM is also known as volatile memory, meaning that its contents are lost when the 					computer is powered off.

	When a program is executed, its instructions and data are loaded into RAM from the computer's storage devices, such as the hard drive or solid-state 			drive. The CPU then accesses this data from RAM as it processes the program's instructions. The more RAM a computer has, the more data it can 				store and the faster it can access that data.

		RAM is measured in units of bytes, with common sizes being 4 GB, 8 GB, 16 GB, and 32 GB or more. RAM is typically installed in modules called 				DIMMs (dual in-line memory modules) that are inserted into slots on the motherboard of a computer.

		It's worth noting that RAM is different from storage devices, such as hard drives or solid-state drives, which are used to permanently store 				data even when the computer is turned off.

3.Where is data is stored in computer?
ans:- Data in a computer is stored in various types of storage devices, including:

		Hard disk drives (HDDs): These are magnetic storage devices that store data on spinning disks. HDDs are commonly used as the main storage device 			in desktop and laptop computers.

		Solid-state drives (SSDs): These are newer storage devices that use flash memory to store data. SSDs are faster and more reliable than HDDs but 			are generally more expensive.

			USB drives and memory cards: These are small, portable storage devices that can be used to store and transfer data between computers and 				other devices.

			Optical drives: These are storage devices that use lasers to read and write data on CDs, DVDs, and Blu-ray discs.

			Cloud storage: This is a type of online storage that allows users to store and access data over the internet. Cloud storage services such 				as Dropbox, Google	 Drive, and iCloud are becoming increasingly popular for storing and sharing data.

			The specific location where data is stored depends on the type of data and the application being used. For example, application data is 				typically stored in a specific folder or directory on the computer's hard drive, while system files and settings are stored in different 					locations on the computer's file system.

4.what is input device used to type text and number on a document in computer system?
Ans:-The input device used to type text and numbers on a document in a computer system is a keyboard. A keyboard is a hardware device that allows users to input text and commands into a computer by pressing buttons or keys. Most computer keyboards have a standard layout consisting of alphanumeric keys (letters and numbers), punctuation keys, function keys, and navigation keys. Some keyboards may also have additional keys for specific purposes, such as multimedia control or shortcut keys for launching specific applications or functions.

5.what are output devices?
Ans:-Output devices are hardware components of a computer system that are used to display or present data that has been processed or generated by the computer. Some common examples of output devices include:

Monitor: This is the most common output device that displays visual output from the computer, such as text, images, videos, and graphics.

Printer: This is an output device that produces hard copies of documents and other digital content on paper or other types of media.

Projector: This is an output device that projects visual output from the computer onto a larger screen or surface, such as a wall or projection screen.

Speakers: These are output devices that produce sound output from the computer, such as music, sound effects, and other audio content.

Headphones: These are output devices that allow users to listen to sound output from the computer privately, without disturbing others.

Braille display: This is an output device that presents digital content in braille format for visually impaired users.

The specific output devices used in a computer system depend on the type of computer and the intended use of the system.

6.which input device allows user to remove cursor or pointer from screen?
Ans:-The input device that allows a user to remove the cursor from the screen is a mouse. A mouse is a pointing device that is used to control the movement of the cursor on the computer screen. The user can move the mouse across a flat surface, and the cursor on the screen will move in a corresponding manner. The mouse typically has at least one button, which can be used to select objects or perform actions on the screen, and some models also have additional buttons or a scroll wheel for scrolling through documents or web pages. The movement of the mouse can be used to control the movement of the cursor in a precise and intuitive manner, making it a very popular input device for computers. Additionally, some computer systems also support other pointing devices, such as touchpads or trackballs, that can be used to control the movement of the cursor on the screen.

7.which language is directly understood by computer without trnslation of programs?
Ans:-The language that is directly understood by the computer without the need for translation is called machine language or machine code. Machine language consists of binary code that is represented by a series of 0s and 1s, which the computer can read and execute directly. Each instruction in machine language corresponds to a specific operation that the computer can perform, such as moving data between registers or performing arithmetic calculations.

However, writing programs in machine language can be extremely difficult and time-consuming for humans, so most programmers use higher-level programming languages that are easier to read and write. These higher-level programming languages need to be translated into machine language before they can be executed by the computer. This translation process is typically performed by a compiler or an interpreter, which converts the source code written in the higher-level programming language into machine language that the computer can understand and execute.

8.what are input devices?
Ans:-Input devices are hardware components of a computer system that allow users to input or enter data and commands into the computer. Some common examples of input devices include:

Keyboard: This is the most common input device that allows users to enter text and commands into the computer by pressing buttons or keys.

Mouse: This is a pointing device that allows users to control the movement of the cursor on the computer screen.

Touchpad: This is a touch-sensitive surface that is typically found on laptops and allows users to control the movement of the cursor by sliding their fingers across the surface.

Scanner: This is an input device that allows users to scan and digitize documents, images, and other physical objects.

Webcam: This is an input device that allows users to capture and record video and images.

Microphone: This is an input device that allows users to record audio and voice input.

Joystick: This is an input device that allows users to control the movement of objects in games and simulations.

Barcode reader: This is an input device that allows users to scan and read barcodes for product information, inventory management, and other purposes.

The specific input devices used in a computer system depend on the type of computer and the intended use of the system.
